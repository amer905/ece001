<h1>Disadvantages of artificial intelligence</h1>
<p> We all are experiencing the benefits of AI, scientists are speculating the brighter future for AI. Though we all are fascinated by concepts like automated cars, personalized shopping, etc, are they any threats from this AI that we all are unaware of?

Let’s find out…

What is AI? It is a subset of computer science applications. What is the main objective of AI-based machines? It is to mimic human activities such that it can be used to augment their natural abilities or ease their lives. Some of the major AI-based software include Google Cloud Machine Learning Engine, TensorFlow, Azure Machine Learning Studio, Cortana, IBM Watson, etc.
However, when you look at the brighter side of a thing, you should acknowledge that there is a darker side to it. Similarly, despite several advantages that AI offers, it also has some disadvantages that we can’t ignore. So, let us look at some of the major disadvantages of AI implementation.
1. HIGH COST OF IMPLEMENTATION

Setting up AI-based machines, computers, etc. entails huge costs given the complexity of engineering that goes into building one. Further, the astronomical expense doesn’t stop there as repair and maintenance also run into thousands of dollars. Do you know how much it cost Apple to acquire its virtual assistant SIRI? The acquisition of the software cost somewhere around a whopping $200 million. Further, the high cost of AI implementation is evident from the fact that Amazon acquired Alexa for $26 million in 2013.
 These AI-based software programs require frequent upgrades in order to cater to the requirements of the changing environment as the machine needs to become smarter by the day. In case the software suffers a severe breakdown, then the process of recovering lost codes and reinstalling the system can give you nightmares due to the huge time and cost involved.
2. CAN’T REPLACE HUMANS

It is beyond any doubt that machines perform much more efficiently as compared to a human being. But even then it is practically impossible to replace humans with AIs, at least in the near future, because you can’t build human intelligence in a machine as it is a gift of nature. So, no matter how smart a machine can become, it can never replace a human.

<h2>Risks and barriers of AI</h2>
<h4>Data availability:</h4> Often,data is presented in isolation across companies or is inconsistent and of low quality,
 presenting a significant challenge for companies seeking to create value from AI at scale.<BR> In order to overcome this barrier,
 it will be vital to draw up a clear strategy from the outset so thatAI data can be extracted in an organized and consistent manner.
<BR>
<h4>Lack of qualified professionals:</h4> Another obstacle that often occurs at the business level for the adoption of AI is the scarcity of profiles with skills and experience in this type of implementations.
<BR> It is crucial in these cases to have professionals who have already worked on projects of the same magnitude.
<BR>
<h4>The cost and implementation time of AI projects</h4> The cost of implementation, both at the time and the economic level, is a very important factor in choosing to execute this type of project.
<BR> Companies that lack internal skills or are not familiar with AI systems,
 must value the outsourcing of both implementation and maintenance in order to obtain successful results in their project
